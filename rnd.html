    <h1>R&amp;D Expenditure</h1>
    <div class="my-4"></div>

    <p class="lead">
      R&amp;D expenditure as a share of GDP measures how much of a country’s economic output is devoted to research and
      development. In this project, it is treated as a policy-relevant input because governments and private sectors can
      influence it through budgets, incentives, and industrial strategy. Comparing R&amp;D intensity across countries helps
      explain differences in innovative capacity, highlights which countries invest consistently in knowledge creation,
      and provides a concrete lever to test whether innovation can be influenced rather than treated as purely structural.

    <h2>Visualization 1 R&amp;D Intensity Distribution Across Countries (2022)</h2>

    <div class="my-3">
      <img src="images/RND1.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Distribution of R&amp;D intensity across countries (2022)">
    </div>

    <p class="viz-text mt-3">
      This histogram shows that R&amp;D intensity is heavily concentrated at low values, meaning most countries spend a
      small share of GDP on research and development. The distribution has a long right tail, indicating a smaller group
      of countries invests much more heavily, which creates large cross-country gaps in innovation inputs. The spread is
      wide even within the middle of the distribution, suggesting that countries with similar income levels can still
      choose very different R&amp;D strategies, which makes R&amp;D a meaningful candidate lever for explaining divergence in
      innovation outcomes.

    <h2>Visualization 2 R&amp;D Investment Inequality (Boxplot, 2022)</h2>

    <div class="my-3">
      <img src="images/RND2.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Inequality in R&amp;D investment across countries (2022)">
    </div>

    <p class="viz-text mt-3">
      The boxplot summarizes the same cross-country R&amp;D intensity data by highlighting central tendency, dispersion,
      and extreme values. The median sits relatively low compared with the upper range, showing that a typical country’s
      R&amp;D share is modest while the upper tail is driven by a handful of very high-investment cases. The presence of
      clear outliers indicates that the global R&amp;D landscape is not just spread out, it has distinct leaders that
      invest at levels far above most peers, which can translate into compounding advantages through sustained knowledge
      accumulation and stronger innovation ecosystems.

    <h2>Visualization 3 R&amp;D Intensity by Group (Low, Medium, High) (2022)</h2>

    <div class="my-3">
      <img src="images/RND3.png" class="img-fluid" alt="R&amp;D intensity by group (2022)">
    </div>

    <p class="viz-text mt-3">
      This grouped violin plot shows how the distribution of R&amp;D intensity differs across low, medium, and high
      investment categories, and it reveals both separation and variation within each group. The low group is tightly
      concentrated near very small values, indicating that many countries invest similarly little, with limited spread.
      The medium group shifts upward and shows broader dispersion, suggesting a wider range of strategies among countries
      that invest at moderate levels. The high group has the highest center and the widest spread, with visible points
      extending well above the rest, indicating that high-investment countries differ substantially even among themselves,
      which matters for later analysis of efficiency and how investment translates into innovation outcomes.
