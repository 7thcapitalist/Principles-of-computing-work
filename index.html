    <h1>Why Are Some Countries Richer Than Others?</h1>
    <div class="my-4"></div>
    <p class="lead">
      Economic inequality between countries is one of the most persistent features of the global economy. Some nations
      consistently generate high incomes and sustained growth, while others remain stuck at low levels of development.
      This project tests whether innovation helps explain these differences and whether innovation can be influenced
      through policy choices. Using cross-country data on GDP per capita, the Global Innovation Index (GII), and R&amp;D
      expenditure, we build a chain from outcomes to mechanisms, then from mechanisms to controllable inputs.

    <h1>Graph 1 Global GDP per Capita Map</h1>

    <iframe src="Visualizations/viz1_gdp_map.html" style="width: 100%; height: 650px; border: 0;"></iframe>

    <p class="viz-text mt-3">
      This map highlights three central features of global income differences. First, GDP per capita varies enormously
      across countries, with some economies producing several times more income per person than others. Second, these
      differences are geographically clustered, as high income countries tend to concentrate in specific regions while
      low income countries dominate others. Third, the persistence of these clusters across time suggests that income
      differences are not short term fluctuations, but reflect deeper structural patterns in the global economy.
    </p>

    <div class="py-3 my-4"></div>

    <h1>Graph 2 GDP per Capita Distribution</h1>

    <img src="images/Visualization 2.png" class="img-fluid">

    <p class="viz-text mt-3">
      The distribution of GDP per capita reveals three important insights about inequality. First, most countries are
      concentrated at relatively low income levels, indicating that high income status is not the global norm. Second,
      a small number of countries occupy the upper tail of the distribution, capturing a disproportionate share of
      global prosperity. Third, the strong right skew of the distribution shows that income differences are large and
      uneven, reinforcing the idea that global inequality is structural rather than marginal.
    </p>

    <div class="py-3 my-4"></div>

    <h1>Graph 3 Innovation Index Distribution</h1>

    <img src="images/Visualization 3.png" class="img-fluid">

    <p class="viz-text mt-3">
      The Innovation Index distribution shows that innovative capacity is not evenly spread across countries. First,
      innovation performance varies widely, with a small group of countries achieving very high scores. Second, many
      countries cluster at lower innovation levels, indicating limited innovation output across much of the world.
      Third, the overall shape of the distribution closely resembles that of income, suggesting a possible connection
      between innovation outcomes and economic development.
    </p>

    <div class="py-3 my-4"></div>

    <h1>Graph 4 Innovation Index vs GDP per Capita</h1>

    <img src="images/Visualization 4.png" class="img-fluid">

    <p class="viz-text mt-3">
      This scatter plot provides three key observations about innovation and income. First, there is a strong positive
      relationship between innovation scores and GDP per capita, indicating that more innovative countries tend to be
      richer. Second, high income countries are tightly clustered at high innovation levels, while low income countries
      are concentrated at lower scores. Third, the limited number of rich but low innovation countries suggests that
      sustained prosperity is rarely achieved without strong innovation performance.
    </p>

    <div class="py-3 my-4"></div>

    <h1>Graph 5 Innovation Index vs GDP Growth</h1>

    <img src="images/Visualization 5.png" class="img-fluid">

    <p class="viz-text mt-3">
      This visualization reveals how innovation relates to economic dynamics over time. First, countries with higher
      innovation scores tend to experience stronger or more stable GDP growth rates. Second, low innovation countries
      often show weaker or more volatile growth performance. Third, the pattern suggests that innovation is associated
      not only with income levels, but also with the ability to sustain economic expansion over longer periods.
    </p>

    <div class="py-3 my-4"></div>

    <h1>Graph 6 R&amp;D Expenditure Distribution</h1>

    <img src="images/Visualization 6.png" class="img-fluid">

    <p class="viz-text mt-3">
      The distribution of R&amp;D expenditure highlights major differences in innovation investment. First, countries
      allocate very different shares of GDP to research and development, ranging from near zero to substantial levels.
      Second, high R&amp;D investment is relatively rare and concentrated among a small group of economies. Third, this
      wide variation indicates that innovation inputs reflect deliberate choices rather than uniform global standards.
    </p>

    <div class="py-3 my-4"></div>

    <h1>Graph 7 R&amp;D Expenditure Map</h1>

    <iframe src="Visualizations/viz7_rnd_map.html" style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0;"></iframe>

    <p class="viz-text mt-3">
      This map shows how R&amp;D investment is distributed across countries and regions. First, high R&amp;D spending
      tends to cluster in the same regions that exhibit high income levels. Second, many low income regions also display
      consistently low R&amp;D investment. Third, the geographic overlap between R&amp;D and income suggests a close
      connection between innovation inputs and broader economic outcomes.
    </p>

    <div class="py-3 my-4"></div>

    <h1>Graph 8 R&amp;D Expenditure vs Innovation Index</h1>

    <img src="images/Visualization 8.png" class="img-fluid">

    <p class="viz-text mt-3">
      This scatter plot provides direct evidence on the link between investment and innovation. First, higher R&amp;D
      expenditure is strongly associated with higher innovation scores across countries. Second, there is noticeable
      dispersion around the trend, indicating that countries with similar investment can achieve different outcomes.
      Third, this variation implies that while R&amp;D is important, other factors influence how effectively investment
      is converted into innovation.
    </p>

    <div class="py-3 my-4"></div>

    <h1>Graph 9 Innovation Efficiency</h1>

    <iframe src="Visualizations/viz9_efficiency.html" style="width: 100%; height: 950px; border: 0;"></iframe>

    <p class="viz-text mt-3">
      The efficiency metric highlights differences in how countries transform R&amp;D into innovation. First, some
      countries generate high innovation outcomes relative to their level of investment. Second, others invest heavily
      but achieve comparatively weaker innovation performance. Third, this spread suggests that institutional quality,
      human capital, and economic structure play a role in shaping innovation efficiency beyond spending alone.
    </p>

    <div class="py-3 my-4"></div>

    <h1>Graph 10 R&amp;D Expenditure vs GDP per Capita</h1>

    <img src="images/Visualization 10.png" class="img-fluid">

    <p class="viz-text mt-3">
      This visualization links innovation inputs directly to income outcomes. First, countries that invest more in
      R&amp;D generally exhibit higher GDP per capita. Second, low R&amp;D investment is rarely associated with high
      income levels. Third, the consistent positive relationship reinforces the idea that innovation investment aligns
      closely with economic prosperity across countries.
    </p>

    <div class="py-3 my-4"></div>

    <h1>Graph 11 Bubble Chart</h1>

    <img src="images/Visualization 11.png" class="img-fluid">

    <p class="viz-text mt-3">
      This chart combines R&amp;D investment, innovation outcomes, and income into a single view. First, countries with
      high R&amp;D and high innovation tend to have the largest GDP per capita values. Second, countries with low values
      on both dimensions are typically among the poorest. Third, the presence of intermediate cases highlights variation
      in development paths and reinforces differences in efficiency and economic structure.
    </p>

    <div class="py-3 my-4"></div>

    <h1>Graph 12 Regional Comparison</h1>

    <img src="images/Visualization 12.png" class="img-fluid">

    <p class="viz-text mt-3">
      Regional boxplots reveal systematic differences in innovation and investment across the world. First, some
      regions consistently display higher median innovation and R&amp;D levels than others. Second, regions with lower
      medians also show tighter distributions, suggesting limited access to innovation capacity. Third, these regional
      gaps help explain why global inequality persists, as countries operate within broader structural environments.
